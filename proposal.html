                        <h2> Overview</h2>
                        The idea of mental health has been a growing issue over the past 20 years. It has become more of a priority and resources for receiving
                        help are needed now more than ever. Mental health can include stress, anxiety, poor feelings about one's self, and many other aspects
                        of thought.

                        <h2> Information Technology Problem</h2>
                        Information regarding a person's own mental health is hard to research. There are a multitude of issues going on with a person and researching
                        by yourself can be tedious and straining. Most tests for mental health are deep within web pages of a psyciatric facility's page or need to
                        be paid for to receive a diagnosis.

                        Most existing solutions to mental health issues are a list of things that people can do. It does not diagnose the problem but just creates
                        a general structure as to how a person would treat multiple different mental health issues. An idea of such list can be found
