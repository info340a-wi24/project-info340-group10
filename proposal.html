                            The idea of mental health has been a growing issue over the past 20 years. It has become
                            more of
                            a priority and resources for receiving
                            help are needed now more than ever. Mental health can include stress, anxiety, poor feelings
                            about one's self, and many other aspects
                            of thought.

                            Information regarding a person's own mental health is hard to research. There are a
                            multitude of
                            issues going on with a person and researching
                            by yourself can be tedious and straining. Most tests for mental health are deep within web
                            pages
                            of a psyciatric facility's page or need to
                            be paid for to receive a diagnosis.

                            does
                            not diagnose the problem but just creates
                            a general structure as to how a person would treat multiple different mental health issues.
